new functions
eval allow to design an instruction as string
for examplem b='whos'
    eval(b) is going to give as an outcome the content of the string but not as a string.
  
    example 2
    myvar='c=rand(3)'
    eval(myvar)=
    c =
    0.9575    0.9706    0.8003
    0.9649    0.9572    0.1419
    0.1576    0.4854    0.4218
    
sprintf
i get the output on screen when i use fprintf, instead, sprintf it is going to give an outcome that can be stored 
in another variable.

Differences:

>> fprintf('Mynumber is %d \n',a)
Mynumber is 1

>> sprintf('Mynumber is %d \n',a)
ans =
Mynumber is 1
