>> fprintf('The content of var a is %d',a)
%after the"%" we specify the format. the most relevant is %d which is for integers, %f for reals %s for strings.
The content of var a is 3>> %if you want a new line you need a special character: \n
>> fprintf('The content of var a is %d\n',a)
The content of var a is 3
>> %if you want to put a tab, you use \t.
>> fprintf('The content of var a is %d tab \t tab\n',a)
The content of var a is 3 tab 	 tab
>> fprintf('The content of var a is %f\n',a)
The content of var a is 3.000000

>> fprintf('The content of var a is %s\n',b)
The content of var a is string
>> fprintf('The content of var a is %d\n',b)

The content of var a is 114
The content of var a is 105
The content of var a is 110
The content of var a is 103
>> %What happened is that,internally encoded the text in a decimal value. So the content
% of variable b for matlab is a veector of 6 different integers/values so matlab is 
>> %computing every string individually as a value.

>> fprintf('The content of var a is %d and var b is %s\n',a,b) %place after comas matters.
The content of var a is 3 and var b is string

%if you want to make appear a slash \ you need to put it twice, otherwise it will
%compute an error.
